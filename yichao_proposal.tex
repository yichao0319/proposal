Networks are constantly generating an enormous amount of rich and diverse information. Such information creates exciting opportunities for network analytics (\eg, the process of gaining knowledge and insights by mining a large amount of network data collected by a diverse set of monitors or sensors). Network analytics can provide deep insights into the complex interactions among network entities, and between human and technology. Example applications include spectrum sensing, channel estimation, data aggregation, network coding, anomaly detection, localization, and activity detection.

A major challenge to enable effective network analytics is how to distinguish inherent data properties from variability introduced by the environment, measurement errors, artifacts, and anomalies. The presence of missing data can further complicate network analytics.

We address the issues by applying compressive sensing to network analytics. Compressive sensing is an effective technique to network analytics. It leverages the presence of structure and redundancy in real data for interpolation and analysis. We first demostarte the feasibility of applying compressive sensing technique to detect events in a huge customer care calls dataset. A systematic method is proposed for detecting events in a major cellular network using customer care call data. 

We then focus the fundamental part of the compressive sensing technique. Our analysis show that many real network matrices are not low rank and violation of low rank assumption significantly reduces the effectiveness of existing compressive sensing approaches. A novel technique is proposed to address the issue which accurately decompose network data represented in the form of a matrix into a low-rank matrix, a sparse anomaly matrix, an error term, and a small noise matrix.

As on-going work, we are exploring to further generalize the compressive sensing technique to accommodate all types of network data. We observe that real-world data may not be low rank due to lack of synchronization and uniform speed. A method to address the issues is proposed which clusters rows and finds the shift to maximize the correlation coefficient among members in the cluster. We plan to extensively evaluate the method by applying it to different applications such as missing value interpolation and activity recognition.
