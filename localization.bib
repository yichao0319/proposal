It points out some future directions in location system, such as location in ad hoc networks, accuracy enhancement, reducing infrastructure cost, sensor fusion, etc.
Active Badge: the badge emits a globally unique ID every 10 secons or on demand. A central server collects this data from infrarred sensors around the building. Limitation: cannot work well with flurescent lighting or direct sunlight due to infrared emissions these light sources generate. Effective rang is a few meters. A large room requires multiple infrared beacons.
Active Bat: an enhancement over Active badge. It uses ultrasound time-of-flight lateration to provide more accurate physical positioning than active badges. It's reported to locate within 9 cm of true position for 95\% of time. Limitation: requires a large fixed-sensor infrastructure throughout the ceiling, and sensitive to the precise placement of the sensors, which limits scalability, ease of deployment, and cost.",

The limitation: in practice, a graph is given, and we don't have luxury to design a graph to be uniquely localizable. Moreover, a graph need to be localized even if there's no unique solution. Therefore the paper is mostly theoretically interesting.",
